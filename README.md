## Social Engineering Attacks: getting smarter.  
Social Engineering seems to be improved on social media.  

## How it started ðŸ¤”  

It all started after creating a new Instagram Account.  

These "Bots" can see that that your account is new and they are going to SPAM you with loads of offers.

## **Everything is automated - Visiting fake online shop**  
We can see a decently made online shop with a variety of products to choose from.  
As you can see at the bottom of the chat there are options to select for pre-defined messages and instructions are given:

## **Buying things from fake online shop "You only need to pay for "shipping"**  
So we are following instructions and decided to add a few items and use their 100% discount code.  
This is the step where we give away:
* Collecting banking details
* Our personal information (email, home address, name and more)

## **Social engineering analysis**  
**While their Instagram page looks great and "legit" we have to check in-depth:**  
**We see that the audience score is really low and the system detected that 78% of followers are fake!**

## Conclusion
* Always check unknown online shops - creation date (Who is - tool) and also on VirusTotal (blacklist).
* Check for suspicious actions or messages from pages
* When a brand reaches out in the DMs you should immediately ask them to move the conversation over the email and provide a temporary email.
* If a brand wants to work with you, they will be happy to take the extra step.
* Brand managers and PR professionals usually reach out via DM when youâ€™ve interacted with them on social media, or if they need your email address.
